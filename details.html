            <p class="case-study-paragraph">London, UK — In a groundbreaking development, researchers have discovered a faster sorting algorithm
                using the practice of Pentecostal tongue speaking. This algorithm, baptized “pentsort”, has the
                potential to revolutionize the field of computer science.</p>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">The researchers found that the rapid language used in Pentecostal tongue speaking closely resembles the
                computational patterns required for sorting.</p>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">“It is truly astonishing,” said Dr. Thompson. “It outperforms traditional methods like ‘quicksort’ and
                ‘satansort’ by a factor of ten.”</p>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">“Aargh blaarg cabbaa dabba,” said one of the participants, “Glug glug shabba shabba.”</p>

            <h2 class="case-study-subtitle">Closing thoughts.</h2>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">The discovery of the “pentsort” algorithm — already added to the C++ Standard Library — has bewildered computer scientists. While its practical applications are yet to be determined, one thing is certain: The divide between technology and religion is not as clear as once believed.</p>
